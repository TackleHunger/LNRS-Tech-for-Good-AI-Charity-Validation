# SIMPLIFIED REQUIREMENTS FOR VOLUNTEERS
# Only the essentials - no enterprise complexity

# Core libraries for GraphQL API calls
requests>=2.31.0
gql[requests]>=3.4.0

# Environment configuration
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Testing
pytest>=7.4.0

# Optional development tools
black>=23.7.0

# REMOVED COMPLEX DEPENDENCIES FOR VOLUNTEER SIMPLICITY:
# - pydantic (validation overkill for charity data)
# - httpx (requests is simpler and more familiar)  
# - graphql-core (included with gql)
# - aiohttp/asyncio-throttle (volunteers don't need async)
# - pandas/numpy (data science overkill for API calls)
# - structlog (standard logging is fine)
# - pytest-asyncio/pytest-mock (testing complexity)
# - mypy/flake8 (type checking can be optional)
