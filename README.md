**📋 Read the [How to Validate Charities Guide](HOW_TO_VALIDATE_CHARITIES.md) - everything you need to know!**

## 🎯 What You'll Do

**Charity Validation Tasks:**
- ✅ Verify charity addresses, phone numbers, websites  
- ✅ Update missing or incorrect information
- ✅ Add new charities to help more families
- ✅ Ensure data quality for food distribution network

**Impact:** Your work helps hungry families find food assistance faster!

## 🚀 Example: Validate a Charity

```python
from src.tackle_hunger.graphql_client import TackleHungerClient
from src.tackle_hunger.site_operations import SiteOperations

# Connect and get charities needing validation
client = TackleHungerClient()
site_ops = SiteOperations(client)
charities = site_ops.get_sites_for_ai(limit=5)

# Update charity information
updated_info = {
    "publicPhone": "555-123-4567",  # Corrected phone
    "website": "https://correctwebsite.org",
    "modifiedBy": "AI_Copilot_Assistant"  # Always include this
}
result = site_ops.update_site(charities[0]['id'], updated_info)
print("✅ Charity updated!")
```

## 🛠 Development Options

**Choose your preferred setup:**

1. **Local Python** (Simplest) - Follow quick start above
2. **GitHub Codespaces** - Cloud development environment ([Guide](docs/codespaces-setup.md))  
3. **Docker** - Containerized environment ([Guide](docs/docker-setup.md))

## 📊 Project Goals

**Target Deliverables:**
1. **Update Missing Info** - Fill in blank charity details
2. **Verify Current Data** - Check addresses, phones, websites work
3. **Add New Charities** - Expand the network to help more families
4. **Ensure Data Quality** - Mark reliable sources, validate information

## 🔒 Important Notes

## Relevant Charity Fields

In the Tackle Hunger Map app, Charities are stored as an Organization & a Site (service location). Charities can have more than 1 service location so Org--<Site is a 1-to-Many relation (however, the vast majority have just 1 Site). Most information is on Sites - charities that haven't interacted with the app yet typically have mostly blank Organization fields.

The only other relevant relations (EligiblePopulations, PlaceTypes, & ServiceTypes) are internally handled - just reference the Schema's Scalar definition for each.

The full Schema is visible on the Staging API GraphQL Playground.

### Fields to Pull

#### Fetching Sites

Relevant Sites fields to fetch are defined in the GraphQL Schema `type SiteForAI`. Request the appropriate ones for your usage in `sitesForAI` queries.

### Fields to Push

#### Create Site

Relevant fields to push when creating a Site are defined in the GraphQL Schema `input siteInputForAI`, a variable used in the `addCharityFromAI` mutation.

`siteId: String` is a separate variable required for the `addCharityFromAI` mutation.

Most `siteInputForAI` fields can be omitted if not intending to set with a value. The 3 Scalar arrays can be omitted, but if included they can't be empty. Only the 5 String fields marked with `!` are required.

Here they are ordered for clarity & explained:

```gql
input siteInputForAI {
  ### LOCATION DETAILS (Food Pickup/Dropoff/Distribution Address, avoid PO Boxes)
  #
  # Any of these 4 changed triggers internal Location-Standardizing
  streetAddress: String! # required for creation

  ###
}
```

#### Update Site

Relevant fields to push when updating a Site are defined in the GraphQL Schema `input siteInputForAIUpdate`, a variable used in the `updateSiteFromAI` mutation.

`siteId: String` is a separate variable required for the `updateSiteFromAI` mutation.

Only a few Organization fields really need to be updated. When a Financial Controller gets invited (which is automatic upon update of `site.financialControllerEmail`), then most Org fields get filled by copying them from its Site. All fields below are welcome if they differ from their Site(s), the Charity is being newly created, or the fields were previously blank.

Any fields not intended to modify can be omitted.

Here they are ordered for clarity & explained:

```gql
input siteInputForAIUpdate {
  ### LOCATION DETAILS (Food Pickup/Dropoff/Distribution Address, avoid PO Boxes)

  #
  dataSource: String # URI or human-readable identifier if found on foreign source list/table/DB with IDs
  dataSourceId: ID # id from the foreign source (if from one with IDs)
  ###
}
```

#### Create Organization

Each Organization must have at least 1 Site to prevent them from getting orphaned  (_so ignore the `createOrganization` mutation - it is deprecated, do not try to use it_).

A new blank Organization is automatically created for each new Site that doesn't specify a preexisting `site.organizationId`.

To add fields to a newly created Organization, first create the Site (`addCharityFromAI` mutation) & request `organizationId` in the response, then use that to update Organization fields via the `updateOrganizationFromAI` mutation explained below.

#### Update Organization

Relevant fields to push when updating an Organization are defined in the GraphQL Schema `input organizationInputUpdate`, a variable used in the `updateOrganizationFromAI` mutation.

`organizationId: String` is a separate variable required for the `updateOrganizationFromAI` mutation.

Any fields not intended to modify can be omitted.

Here they are ordered for clarity & explained:

```gql
input organizationInputUpdate {
  ### LOCATION DETAILS
  #
  # Parent Organization Mailing Address, PO box is fine, public but not shown on the Map

## Potential Projects / Target Goals / Deliverables

- Common to each:

  - store mailing address separately if it differs from the food pickup/dropoff address
    - _a non-food-service address like a PO box goes on the related Organization, as opposed to the Site (see schemas)_
  - ensure they're open year-round (as opposed to seasonal, like school or summer programs)
  - potentially have the AI give a data-reliability score for each result
    - i.e. higher if verified from multiple sources, favored sources, conforms to key phrases
    - _in our current setup, new Charities submitted are marked Pending until a human does a quick check - this could help with that review_
    - could also potentially push very good ones to our API to immediately go live  (_i.e. not Pending_)
  - automate it - deliver some amount of infrastructure-as-code that'd run it automatically (i.e. github actions, crons, webhook triggers, etc.)

1. Find Info that our Current Charities are Missing & Verify their Operational Status

   - i.e. blank, missing, or really poor quality field values
   - push fields that were previously empty to our API (_`mutation updateSiteFromAI`_) - if you think they're good enough we can save them immediately
   - store a copy of our original data & the new recommended data at that moment in time, as well as links to our Site/Org & to the new source
     - _in a new storage bucket or DB for this project_

2. Scrape Facebook for Charities  (_added to any of these other projects_)

   - would probably be best as a helper-function to run within any of these other automated-scraping goals
   - _many of our Charities don't have main websites and use social media as their only up-to-date source on hours, status, & contact info_
   - _we don't have experience automating this yet, would love help_

3. Find New Charities that we don't currently have

   - requires serious & careful deduplication - _it's counter-productive if we have to manually deal with multiples of the same charity_
   - find trustworthy values for as many fields as possible & fill them in
   - push them to our API (_`mutation addCharityFromAI`_)
     - _new additions are Pending until a member of the Tackle Hunger team approves them_
   - potentially, if the AI gives a data-reliability score, push very good ones to our API to immediately go live  (_i.e. not Pending_)
     - would require an additional endpoint/mutation or changes to the current one - TBD

4. Re-check our Current Charities to Find Newer Data & Flag ones that might have changed

   - store a copy of our original data & the new recommended data at that moment in time, as well as links to our Site/Org & to the new source
     - _in a new storage bucket or DB for this project_
   - potentially, if the AI gives a data-reliability score, push very good ones to our API to immediately go live (_`mutation updateSiteFromAI`_)
