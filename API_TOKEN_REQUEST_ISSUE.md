# Request API Token for LNRS Tech for Good Volunteer Access

## Summary
The LNRS Tech for Good team needs access to the `AI_SCRAPING_TOKEN` to begin charity validation work. We have successfully set up development environments and confirmed API connectivity, but need authentication credentials to perform data operations.

## What I Need
- `AI_SCRAPING_TOKEN` for LNRS Tech for Good team development environments
- Any usage guidelines or rate limits for team access

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Ready to work:**
- Development environment set up and tested
- All tests passing (7/7)
- API connectivity confirmed
- Documentation reviewed

‚ùå **Blocked by authentication:**
- Cannot query `sitesForAI` (requires token)
- Cannot perform charity validation operations

## How We'll Use It
- Validate and update charity information (addresses, phone numbers, websites)
- Add new charities to expand the food assistance network
- Follow guidelines in `HOW_TO_VALIDATE_CHARITIES.md`
- Mark all operations with `modifiedBy: "AI_Copilot_Assistant"`

## Contact
- **Team**: LNRS Tech for Good 
- **GitHub**: @JoneRo01

Thank you for helping families find food assistance! üçΩÔ∏è
