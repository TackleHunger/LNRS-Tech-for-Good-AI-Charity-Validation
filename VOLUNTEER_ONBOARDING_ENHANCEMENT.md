# Documentation Enhancement: Volunteer Onboarding Checklist

## Problem
New volunteers need a clear, step-by-step checklist to get started effectively. Current documentation is spread across multiple files without a unified getting-started experience.

## Proposed Enhancement
Create a comprehensive volunteer onboarding checklist that consolidates:

1. **Pre-requisites Check**:
   - Python 3.13 installation
   - Git setup
   - Development environment (local vs Codespaces vs Docker)

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Repository cloning
   - Dependency installation
   - Environment configuration
   - API token request process

3. **Verification Steps**:
   - Connectivity tests
   - Test suite execution
   - Sample API queries

4. **First Contribution Guide**:
   - Charity validation workflow
   - Code style guidelines
   - Commit message format
   - Pull request process

## Benefits
- Reduces time-to-productivity for new volunteers
- Standardizes onboarding experience
- Minimizes support requests for common setup issues
- Improves volunteer retention and contribution quality

## Implementation
Could be added as `VOLUNTEER_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md` or integrated into existing quick start guide.

## Impact
Makes the project more accessible to volunteers with varying technical backgrounds.
