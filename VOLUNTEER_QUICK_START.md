# Volunteer Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Tackle Hunger Charity Validation project! This guide will get you productive in minutes.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Run the automated setup:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_dev_environment.py
   ```

2. **Configure your environment:**
   - Edit `.env` file with API credentials (get from GitHub secrets/team lead)
   - Test connectivity: `python scripts/test_connectivity.py`

3. **Verify everything works:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll Be Working On

**Charity Validation Operations:**
- Validating charity site information (addresses, contacts, services)
- Updating charity organization details
- Ensuring data quality for food distribution network

**Key APIs:**
- GraphQL API for charity data (dev/staging/production)

## ðŸ›  Development Workflow

**For charity validation tasks:**
```python
from src.tackle_hunger.graphql_client import TackleHungerClient
from src.tackle_hunger.site_operations import SiteOperations

# Initialize client
client = TackleHungerClient()
site_ops = SiteOperations(client)

# Get sites needing validation
sites = site_ops.get_sites_for_ai(limit=10)

# Process and update sites
# (Your validation logic here)
```

## ðŸ”’ Security & API Keys

- **Never commit API keys** - they're in `.env` (git-ignored)
- Use **dev environment** for development
- Mark all operations with `createdMethod="AI_Copilot_Assistant"`

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?
