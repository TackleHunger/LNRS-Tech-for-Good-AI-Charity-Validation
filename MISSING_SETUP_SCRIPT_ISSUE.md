# Missing Development Setup Script Referenced in Documentation

## Problem
Documentation references `scripts/setup_dev_environment.py` for automated setup, but this script doesn't exist in the repository.

## Current Impact
- VOLUNTEER_QUICK_START.md step 1 instructs: `python scripts/setup_dev_environment.py`
- New volunteers get "file not found" error on first setup step
- Forces manual environment configuration for all new contributors

## Expected Behavior
- Setup script should exist and automate initial environment configuration
- Should create `.env` from `.env.example` with placeholder values
- Should verify Python dependencies and run initial connectivity tests

## Files Affected
- **Documentation**: `VOLUNTEER_QUICK_START.md` (line 10)
- **Missing**: `scripts/setup_dev_environment.py`

## Suggested Solution
Either:
1. Create the missing setup script, or
2. Update documentation to reflect manual setup process

## Priority
High - This is the first step new volunteers encounter and currently fails.
